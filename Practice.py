'''this is also taking input, but if i want to take a number, character, float value from user, 
then i will name a variable and in that variable i can take 'int', 'char', 'float' accordingly'''

'''for addition of 2 numbers, w have to declare 2 variables and the values in it, or we can take input from user also...'''

#now this is addition of 2 nums. and printing the result.
#also we can perform all arithmatic operations by the same method, only replacing the signs.
